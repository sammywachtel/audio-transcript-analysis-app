# Timestamp Alignment Architecture Decision

## Problem Statement

Gemini 2.5 Flash produces excellent transcription content (text, speakers, terms, topics) but unreliable timestamps:
- **Observed drift**: 8-10 seconds off in a 2-minute file
- **Pattern**: Linear drift that worsens over time (systematic, not random)
- **Root cause**: Gemini likely estimates timestamps from text features rather than actual audio analysis

## Expert Analysis Summary

A multi-expert analysis was conducted with perspectives from:
- Speech Recognition Researchers
- Audio Signal Processing Engineers
- Python Backend Architects
- ML Engineers
- Cost Optimization Specialists

### Key Insights

1. **Linear drift pattern** indicates simple ratio scaling could provide immediate improvement
2. **Forced alignment** is the proper solution (matching text to audio waveform)
3. **Hybrid approach** recommended: Keep Gemini for content, add timing from WhisperX or similar
4. **Don't sync in real-time** - process once, store accurate timestamps

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Client-Side Drift Compensation (Immediate)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Accuracy Target**: <2 seconds (down from 8-10)

Simple ratio-based scaling using actual audio duration vs. transcript duration:
```javascript
function compensateDrift(segments, audioDuration) {
  const transcriptDuration = segments[segments.length-1].endMs;
  const ratio = audioDuration / transcriptDuration;
  return segments.map(s => ({
    ...s,
    startMs: Math.round(s.startMs * ratio),
    endMs: Math.round(s.endMs * ratio)
  }));
}
```

This leverages the existing drift detection code but applies it more aggressively.

### Phase 2: WhisperX via Replicate API (Integrated into Firebase Functions)
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Consolidated)
**Effort**: 14-21 hours initial, then consolidated into Functions
**Accuracy Target**: <1 second (~50ms with forced alignment)

Architecture (Current - Consolidated):
```

└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

**Why WhisperX over OpenAI Whisper API?**
- OpenAI's API has word-level timestamps but they can still drift on long-form audio
- WhisperX adds **forced alignment** with wav2vec2 phoneme model
- Forced alignment matches audio waveforms to phonemes = ~50ms accuracy

**Implementation (Consolidated):**
1. **functions/src/alignment.ts** - HARDY algorithm in TypeScript
   - Complete port from Python `aligner.py`
   - Uses `fuzzball` npm package for fuzzy matching
   - Uses `replicate` npm package for WhisperX API calls
   - Called directly by `transcribe.ts` (no HTTP overhead)

2. **Server-side processing:**
   - Alignment runs automatically during transcription
   - No client-side "Improve Timestamps" button needed
   - Status stored in Firestore: `alignmentStatus: 'aligned'` or `'fallback'`

3. **HARDY Alignment Algorithm (4 levels):**
   - **Level 1**: Anchor Point Identification (high-confidence matches)
   - **Level 2**: Region Segmentation (divide transcript at anchors)
   - **Level 3**: Regional Alignment (DTW-style matching per region)
   - **Level 4**: Validation & Fallback (quality gates, graceful degradation)

**Cost:** ~$0.02 per 10-minute audio file
**Latency:** Eliminated HTTP overhead by running in-process

### Phase 3: Manual Offset Control (Optional)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Effort**: 4-8 hours

Add UI slider for users to manually fine-tune sync if automated alignment isn't perfect.

**Implementation:**
- "Sync" button in AudioPlayer footer (desktop only)
- Click to reveal offset controls popup
- Quick buttons: -1s, -0.5s, +0.5s, +1s
- Full slider: -30s to +30s range
- Reset button to return to 0
- Visual indicator when offset is applied (amber color)

## Cost Analysis

| Solution | Cost per Audio Hour | Dev Time | Accuracy |
|----------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Phase 1 (ratio scaling) | $0 | 2 hours | ~2 seconds |
| AssemblyAI API | $0.65 | 8 hours | <0.5 seconds |
| Self-hosted WhisperX | $0.0125 | 40 hours | <0.5 seconds |
| Replicate Whisper | $0.03 | 4 hours | <0.5 seconds |

## Decision

**Proceed with Phase 1 immediately**, then evaluate if Phase 2 is needed based on user feedback.

Rationale:
- Phase 1 provides immediate improvement with zero infrastructure changes
- Linear drift pattern suggests ratio scaling will be effective
- Can measure improvement before investing in backend infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Changes Completed

1. **Enhanced drift correction** in `useAudioPlayer.ts`:
   - ✅ Lowered threshold from >5% AND >2s to just >1s difference
   - ✅ Added drift metrics tracking: `driftRatio`, `driftCorrectionApplied`, `driftMs`
   - ✅ Improved rounding with `Math.round()` instead of `Math.floor()`
   - ✅ Added detailed console logging for debugging

2. **Added sync indicator** in UI (`ViewerHeader.tsx`):
   - ✅ "⚡ Sync Adjusted" badge appears when drift correction was applied
   - ✅ Tooltip shows percentage adjustment and milliseconds of drift detected
   - ✅ "Auto-Syncing" spinner shows during correction

3. **Testing** (remaining):
   - Short (2 min), medium (10 min), long (1+ hour)
   - Different audio qualities and speaker counts

### Success Metrics

- Timestamp accuracy within 2 seconds (Phase 1)
- Timestamp accuracy within 1 second (Phase 2)
- No user-reported sync issues
- Processing time under 30 seconds for 2-hour files

## Deployment Instructions (Consolidated Architecture)

### Prerequisites
1. Firebase project with Cloud Functions enabled
2. Replicate account with API token

### One-Time Setup: Set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN Secret

```bash
# Set the Replicate API token as a Firebase secret
npx firebase functions:secrets:set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN
# Enter your token when prompted (get from https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)

# Verify the secret was created
npx firebase functions:secrets:access REPLICATE_API_TOKEN
```

### Deployment (Automated via CI/CD)

Alignment is now part of Firebase Functions and deploys automatically:

1. **On merge to main**: GitHub Actions runs `deploy-firebase-functions` job
2. **Job steps**:
   - `npm ci` - Install dependencies (including `fuzzball`, `replicate`)
   - `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
   - `firebase deploy --only functions` - Deploy to Firebase

No separate alignment service deployment needed.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy functions
cd functions && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
npx firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev

# Functions run in Firebase emulator (optional)
npx firebase emulators:start --only functions
```

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check function logs after uploading an audio file
npx firebase functions:log --only transcribeAudio

# Look for:
# [Alignment] Preparing request...
# [WhisperX] ✅ Transcription complete
# [HARDY] ✅ Alignment complete, avg_confidence=X.XXX
```
