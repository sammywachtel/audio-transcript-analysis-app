## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Audio Chunking for Large Files** - Files over 30 minutes are now automatically split into 10-15 minute chunks
  - FFmpeg-based silence detection finds natural break points (using `-af silencedetect=n=-30dB:d=0.5`)
  - Chunks include 5-10 second overlap to prevent word truncation at boundaries
  - Each chunk processed as separate Cloud Task, staying within Cloud Function time limits
  - Chunk metadata stored in Firestore for downstream merge/deduplication (Scope 5c)
  - New `ProcessingStep.CHUNKING` shows chunking progress in UI
- **Chunk Context Propagation** - Speaker identity and metadata maintained across chunk boundaries
  - Each chunk emits a `ChunkContext` with speaker mappings, summary, and extracted IDs
  - Next chunk loads previous context to maintain diarization continuity
  - Firestore transactions ensure atomic status updates even with concurrent chunk tasks
  - Resumable execution: failed/pending chunks can be retried with correct state bootstrap
- **Chunk Merge System** - Automatic reassembly of chunked transcripts into a unified document
  - Segments deduplicated in overlap regions using "later chunk wins" strategy
  - Timestamps normalized from chunk-local to original audio timeline for accurate playback sync
  - Speakers, terms, topics, and people merged deterministically across all chunks
  - Cloud Task-based merge job with `mergeTaskEnqueued` guard to prevent duplicate merges
  - Conversation status transitions: `chunking` → `merging` → `complete`

### Changed
- **Queue-Driven Transcription Architecture** - Large audio files (46MB+) now process reliably without timeouts
  - Storage trigger (`transcribeAudio`) now acts as lightweight enqueuer (< 5 seconds), setting status to `queued`
  - New HTTP function (`processTranscription`) handles heavy processing with 60-minute timeout
  - Cloud Tasks provides automatic retry with exponential backoff on failures
  - Emulator bypass allows local development without Cloud Tasks infrastructure
  - **Breaking:** Requires one-time Cloud Tasks queue setup (`transcription-queue`) - see `docs/how-to/deploy.md`

### Fixed
- **Large File Upload Timeouts** - Root cause addressed via queue architecture (above)
  - Node.js undici `headersTimeout` extended to 25 minutes (fixes `HeadersTimeoutError`)
  - Gemini API calls configured with 20-minute SDK-level timeout
  - Replicate API calls configured with 3-minute timeout via custom fetch wrapper
  - Gateway errors (502/503/504) now trigger automatic retries in WhisperX transcription
- **Firestore Race Condition** - Storage trigger now uses `set()` with merge instead of `update()`, preventing errors when file upload completes before frontend creates document
- **Chunk Processing Retry Errors** - Fixed Firestore error when retrying failed chunks
  - Chunk status updates now properly omit error field instead of setting it to `undefined`
  - Prevents "Cannot use undefined as a Firestore value" errors during chunk retry operations

## [1.8.0-beta] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Admin Cost Visibility Dashboard** - Comprehensive cost transparency tools for finance and operations
  - Job Detail view at `/admin/jobs/:metricId` with timing breakdowns, token usage, pricing snapshots, and Replicate prediction links
  - Chat metrics tab aggregating conversational queries by conversation with token usage and response time analytics
  - Cost Reconciliation report at `/admin/reports/cost-reconciliation` with weekly/monthly summaries, variance detection (>5% highlighted), and CSV export
  - Cost verification badges showing estimated vs. current pricing with ✓/⚠️/❌ status indicators
- **User Cost Visibility** - Pricing accuracy indicator on My Stats page
  - Shows whether stored costs match current configured rates (✓ match / ⚠️ minor / ❌ significant variance)
  - Displays timestamp when rates were captured
  - Includes disclaimer about configured vs actual billing rates
  - Admin users see "View cost breakdown" link to admin dashboard

### Changed
- **Vertex AI SDK Migration** - Replaced `@google/generative-ai` with `@google-cloud/vertexai` for billing label support
  - All 6 Gemini API calls now include billing labels (`conversation_id`, `user_id`, `call_type`, `environment`)
  - Enables cost tracking and reconciliation via GCP billing reports
  - Updated `transcribeWithWhisperX()` to return `predictionId` for all successful transcriptions
  - Authentication changed from API key to service account credentials
- **Cost Display Centralization** - Removed inline cost estimates from modals
  - Delete and abort confirmation modals no longer show dollar amounts
  - Users directed to My Stats page for accurate cost information
  - Prevents displaying ad-hoc cost guesses during active processing

### Fixed
- Admin dashboard URL routing now properly handles `/admin`, `/admin/jobs/:id`, and `/admin/reports/cost-reconciliation` paths
- Job detail views now correctly load metric data using Firestore document IDs
- Cost Reconciliation report period dates now use local timezone instead of UTC to prevent off-by-one date errors
- Pricing accuracy indicator now correctly shows "No pricing configured" when `_pricing` collection is empty (previously showed false "match" status)
